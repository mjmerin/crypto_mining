NiceHash
============================

This guide assumes you have read through [README](README.md) and still have uncertainties or are hesitant about purchasing the required hardware. 

The gist of [Nicehash](https://www.nicehash.com/) is to allow you to "loan" your computer's hashing power to miners on the internet. In return you get Bitcoins. 

[Nicehash](https://www.nicehash.com/) will just about use any computer hardware available. However please use their [Profitability Calculator](https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator/) to determine if it is worth your time and effort.
